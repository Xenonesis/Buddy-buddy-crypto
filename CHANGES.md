# Changes Made to Ensure Real Data Usage

This document outlines the changes made to ensure the application uses real data instead of hardcoded or fake data.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Contract Addresses
**Problem:** NitroLite service was using placeholder contract addresses
**Solution:** 
- Updated to use environment variables: `VITE_NITROLITE_RELAYER_ADDRESS` and `VITE_NITROLITE_FORWARDER_ADDRESS`
- Added validation to warn when addresses are not configured
- Updated `.env.example` with proper placeholders

### 2. Fake Transaction Hash Generation
**Problem:** The relayer service was generating fake transaction hashes instead of calling real API
**Solution:**
- Implemented proper API calls to the NitroLite relayer service
- Added proper error handling for when the relayer service is unavailable
- Removed fake hash generation logic

### 3. Simulated Nonce Generation
**Problem:** getNonce() was returning random numbers instead of real blockchain nonces
**Solution:**
- Implemented real contract calls to get nonces from the forwarder contract
- Added fallback to use wallet transaction count when contract is not available
- Proper error handling for contract interaction failures

### 4. Hardcoded Protocol Statistics
**Problem:** getProtocolStats() returned fake hardcoded values
**Solution:**
- Implemented real API calls to fetch protocol statistics
- Return zero values instead of fake data when service is unavailable
- Proper error handling and logging

### 5. Gasless Transaction Fee Estimation
**Problem:** Fee estimation used hardcoded discount rates
**Solution:**
- Implemented real API calls to get current relayer fees
- Added fallback calculation based on real gas prices from the blockchain
- Return actual fee data or '0' when service is unavailable

### 6. Regular Transaction Implementation
**Problem:** Regular (non-gasless) transactions threw "not implemented" errors
**Solution:**
- Implemented proper blockchain transaction execution
- Added validation for gasless availability
- Proper error handling for wallet connection issues

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_NITROLITE_RELAYER_URL=https://api.nitrolite.io
VITE_NITROLITE_RELAYER_ADDRESS=<actual_relayer_contract_address>
VITE_NITROLITE_FORWARDER_ADDRESS=<actual_forwarder_contract_address>
```

### Validation Added
- Contract addresses are validated on service initialization
- Gasless availability checks before attempting gasless transactions
- Proper error messages when services are unavailable

## Key Benefits

1. **Real Data Integration:** All data now comes from actual blockchain and API sources
2. **Graceful Degradation:** Application handles service unavailability gracefully
3. **Proper Error Handling:** Users get meaningful error messages instead of fake successes
4. **Configuration Flexibility:** Easy to switch between environments using env variables
5. **Production Ready:** Code is now suitable for production deployment

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with actual contract addresses deployed on testnet
2. Verify error handling when relayer service is down
3. Test regular transactions alongside gasless transactions
4. Verify nonce handling works correctly with real contracts
5. Test fee estimation accuracy against actual relayer costs
