# Transaction Status Synchronization Fix

## Problem Description
The application was showing confirmed transactions as pending in the database, causing confusion for users. This happened because transaction status updates were only being saved to local state and localStorage, but not synchronized with the database.

## Root Cause
In the `TransactionService.checkPendingTransactions()` method, when a transaction status was updated from "pending" to "confirmed" or "failed", the code only updated:
1. Local in-memory state (`tx.status = newStatus`)
2. localStorage (`this.saveTransactions()`)

But it **did not** update the database, causing the database to retain stale "pending" status even for confirmed transactions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Database Update Method
Created `updateTransactionInDatabase()` method to properly sync status changes to the database:

```typescript
private async updateTransactionInDatabase(hash: string, status: string, gasUsed?: string): Promise<void> {
  // Updates transaction status in Supabase database
}
```

### 2. Fixed Transaction Status Checking
Updated `checkPendingTransactions()` to include database synchronization:

```typescript
// Before: Only updated local state
tx.status = receipt.status === 1 ? 'confirmed' : 'failed';
this.saveTransactions();

// After: Updates local state AND database
const newStatus = receipt.status === 1 ? 'confirmed' : 'failed';
tx.status = newStatus;
await this.updateTransactionInDatabase(tx.hash, newStatus, newGasUsed);
this.saveTransactions();
```

### 3. Enhanced Transaction Processing
Improved `processTransaction()` to handle existing transactions that might need status updates.

### 4. Added Manual Sync Functionality
- Created `syncAllTransactionStatuses()` method to manually sync all transactions
- Added public `manualSyncTransactions()` method for external access
- Integrated periodic sync into the monitoring interval
- Added sync button to the TransactionList UI component

### 5. Improved Database Loading
Enhanced `loadTransactionsFromDatabase()` with better error handling and field mapping.

## Features Added

### Manual Sync Button
- Added "Sync Status" button in the TransactionList component
- Shows loading state while syncing
- Automatically refreshes transaction data after sync

### Automatic Periodic Sync
- Runs full transaction sync approximately every 5 minutes during monitoring
- Ensures long-term consistency between blockchain and database

### Better Logging
- Added detailed console logging for sync operations
- Shows which transactions are being updated and their status changes

## Testing
1. Check transactions with pending status in database
2. Click "Sync Status" button or wait for automatic sync
3. Verify that confirmed transactions now show correct status in database
4. Monitor console logs for sync activity

## Files Modified
- `src/services/transactions.ts` - Main transaction service logic
- `src/components/TransactionList.tsx` - Added sync button UI
- Created temporary test file for verification

## Usage
Users can now:
1. **Automatic**: Transaction status will sync automatically during monitoring
2. **Manual**: Click the "Sync Status" button to force immediate synchronization
3. **Periodic**: Full sync runs every ~5 minutes during active monitoring

This ensures that the database always reflects the actual blockchain transaction status, eliminating confusion about transaction states.
