# Transaction Functionality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Gasless Transaction Errors
**Problem:** Application was trying to connect to non-existent gasless infrastructure
- Failed API calls to `api.nitrolite.io` 
- Contract calls to placeholder addresses
- Fee estimation failures

**Solution:**
- Disabled gasless transactions completely (`isGaslessAvailable()` returns `false`)
- Simplified fee estimation to use real gas price calculation
- Updated UI to show only regular transactions

### 2. Real Transaction Implementation
**Problem:** Transaction submission had incomplete validation and error handling

**Solution:**
- Added proper balance validation (amount + gas fees)
- Improved gas price estimation using real blockchain data
- Better error messages for insufficient funds
- Added proper gas limit calculation (21000 for ETH transfers)

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
**Problem:** Confusing gasless options when they weren't working

**Solution:**
- Removed gasless toggle switches and tabs
- Clear messaging about regular transactions
- Real-time fee calculation and display
- Better transaction summary with accurate totals

## How It Works Now

1. **Connect Wallet**: Users connect MetaMask or WalletConnect
2. **Enter Details**: Recipient address and amount
3. **Real-time Validation**: 
   - Address format validation
   - Balance checking (including gas fees)
   - Gas price estimation from network
4. **Submit Transaction**: 
   - Uses standard Web3 transaction method
   - Proper gas limit and price
   - Real blockchain submission
5. **Track Status**: Transaction monitoring and status updates

## Key Code Changes
